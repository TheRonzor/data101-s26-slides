          <li>
            Without a doubt, research and better computational/mathematical
            techniques, but especially...
          </li>
          <li>Larger and more complex networks of (mathematical) neurons.</li>

            Perhaps we will eventually be able to reduce the size of these
            models while retaining performance. As it stands now, scale is one
            of the most important ingredients. Data centers are huge and their energy
            requirements are on the scale of small cities.

            From a course I taught in 2019. Using a GPT-2 like model, I entered the text in bold, it filled in the rest. Groundbreaking at the time, it was basically a fancy autocomplete tool that would go off the rails after a few paragraphs.
