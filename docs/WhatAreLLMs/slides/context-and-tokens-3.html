              LLMs tend to perform better when they have more context about what
              you are trying to do.
            </li>
            <li>
              The more room you give the LLM to guess, the more likely it is to
              guess incorrectly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide constraints and clear goals, even including the
              format/style of the response you want:
            </li>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Bad: "Can you help me improve my presentation?"</li>
              <li>
                Slightly Better: "Edit this paragraph to make it more clear and
                professional."
              </li>
              <li>
                Much Better: "Edit this paragraph so that it is more
                understandable to an audience of first-year college students
                with no programming experience. Retain the original meaning,
                keep the final version between 200-300 words, and provide 3
                bullet points explaining the most important changes you made and
                why you made them. Provide the edited paragraph first, and the
                bullet list below it.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Even better than the last version would be to have some other
              document(s) you have provided the LLM, for example a course
              description/syllabus.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you don't like what you get, try to identify exactly what it is
              you don't like, be as clear as possible about it, and work
              iteratively - one issue at a time.
