          LLMs are generative models trained on LOTS of text to produce
          language.
        </h1>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>
            They can do things like: continue text, answer questions, summarize,
            translate, and even write computer code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Their ability to create images and audio is separate from their
            language capabilities, but many "LLMs" (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) now
            have these features integrated into a single interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            They are not actually "intelligent"! While they can come across as
            very human-like, this is because they have been trained on an entire
            internet of human-created content. A human, even if they devoted
            every waking moment of their life, could not even scratch the
            surface of the entirety of humanity's digital content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Their use of language, and even reasoning capabilities, can often
            seem impressive. However, when they fail, they often do so in very
            peculiar and non-human ways.
          </li>
          <div class="card">
            <strong>Very Important:</strong> LLMs are not truth engines. They
            are language models trained to predict the next word*. They are
            getting very good at this, but do not lose sight of this fact!
