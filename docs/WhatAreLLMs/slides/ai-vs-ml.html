              For now, let's all agree that
              <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> refers to systems that perform
              tasks we associate with intelligence (which we don't even have a
              definition for itself), whether or not they would pass a Turing
              Test.<br /><br />
              Such tasks might include:
              <ul class="bullets">
                <li>
                  Perception: E.g., Seeing, hearing, or otherwise
                  recording/processing external information so that they can do
                  things like...
                </li>
                <li>Prediction: What is likely to happen next?</li>
                <li>Decision making: What action should/will I take next?</li>
                <li>
                  Communication: Sharing knowledge, in a meaningful way, with
                  other externals (people, systems).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Machine Learning</b>: Systems that learn patterns from data
              (e.g., Decision Trees, clustering algorithms, "simple" neural
              networks). More on that later, but I don't think any rational
              person would consider these "intelligent", even artificially!
            </li>
