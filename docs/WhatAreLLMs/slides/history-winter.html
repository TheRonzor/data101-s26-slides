              Largely attributed to the work of Minsky and Papert, research into
              the perceptron style of AI stagnated for a decade or two.

            <li>
              The book mathematically proved that certain classes of problems
              (such as the XOR problem) could never be learned by a system such
              as the Mark I.
            </li>
            <li>
              The book did not prove that no such machine learning was possible
              - but the next major step forward would not come until the 1980s.
            </li>
            <li>
              By the way - there's a significant structural difference between
              the images on the top and bottom of the book cover. Can you spot
              it? <i>Hint: It's not just that they are oriented differently</i>.
