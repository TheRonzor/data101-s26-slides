            <li><b>Claim</b>: Vaccinations are linked to autism.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Evidence</b>: A study published by (former doctor) Andrew
              Wakefield in 1998.
            </li>
            <li><b>Inference</b>: We should not vaccinate our children.</li>
            <li>
              Many believed (and some still do) that the inference was correct.
              The paper, at first glance, might seem "legit". It was published
              by a doctor after all! In this sense, the inference is reasonable.
            </li>
            <li>
              The paper was later found to be fraudulent and riddled with
              methodological flaws. It was officially retracted by the publisher
              about 10 years later, several of the other authors withdrew their
              support, and Wakefield had his medical license revoked.
