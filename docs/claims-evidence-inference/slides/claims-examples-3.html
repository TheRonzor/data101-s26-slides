            <b>Claim</b>: It is possible that regions of spacetime exist which
            are so densely packed with matter that it would all collapse into an
            infinitely dense point and the resulting gravitational force would
            prevent anything, even light, from ever escaping.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Evidence</b>: Originally, just a mathematical theory (Einstein's
            theory of General Relativity).
          </li>
          <li><b>Inference</b>: Black holes exist.</li>
          <li>
            Einstein himself did not believe this. He thought it was a
            mathematical artifact that couldn't possibly reflect physical
            reality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since then, much indirect (gravitational effects on other visible
            bodies) and direct (imaging of objects such as M87* and Sagittarius
            A*) evidence has been accumulated.
