            determined to be true or false.

            <b>Evidence</b>: The available body of facts or information

            citations, or documents.

            <b>Inference</b>: A conclusion based on evidence and reasoning.

          <li><b>Claim</b>: There are 4 prime numbers between 1 and 10.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Evidence</b>: One can easily check that there are exactly 4 prime
            numbers between 1 and 10, namely, 2, 3, 5, and 7.
          </li>
          <li>

            interval.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is not a reasonable inference and it is also flat-out wrong. In
            mathematics, we do not prove things by example unless we can list
            all possible examples. Moreover, one can readily find a
            counterexample - there are no prime numbers in the 10-number
            interval between 114 and 123.

              Wakefield in 1998.

            <li><b>Inference</b>: We should not vaccinate our children.</li>

              Many believed (and some still do) that this was true. The paper,

              The paper was later found to be fraudulent and riddled with
              methodological flaws. It was officially retracted by the publisher
              about 10 years later, several of the other authors withdrew their
              support, and Wakefield had his medical license revoked.

            <b>Claim</b>: It is possible that regions of spacetime exist which
            are so densely packed with matter that the resulting gravitational
            force would prevent anything, even light, from ever escaping.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Evidence</b>: Originally, just a mathematical theory (Einstein's
            Theory of General Relativity)
          </li>
          <li><b>Inference</b>: Black holes exist.</li>
          <li>
            Einstein himself did not believe this. He thought it was a
            mathematical artifact that couldn't possibly reflect physical
            reality.

          <li>
            Since then, much indirect (gravitational effects on other visible
            bodies) and direct (imaging of objects such as M87* and Sagittarius
            A*) evidence has been accumulated.

            this month, and the number of visits increased from 420 in January,
